Nick is our trouble-shooter with a passion for the largest human organ. He wrote his master thesis on the growth factor signalling in the skin at the ETH Institute of Molecular Health Sciences and has been involved in research in dermatology since 2018. Currently, he is involved in the organisation of research projects and coordination with collaborators, conducts preliminary experiments, and establishes biobanking for our group.

His motto: sunscreen and subscribe...to our research!
