Yongxing is currently serving as a junior resident specializing in dermatology at the University Hospital of Zurich. During his time at the University of Freiburg medical school, he successfully completed his doctor med candidature on the topic of genome and epigenome editing. His research focused on improving the functionality and versatility of the DNA binding domain known as the transcription activator-like effector (TALE), in addition to participating in the development of complex fluorescent reporter systems. Following his training in internal medicine, he worked as a sub-Investigator for the PRORAD study, where he gained valuable experience in clinical research by investigating atopic dermatitis and its comorbidities. Additionally, he has a strong interest in the field of drug eruption, which lies at the intersection of dermatology and allergology. His main areas of interest revolve around translational research and experimental dermatology.
