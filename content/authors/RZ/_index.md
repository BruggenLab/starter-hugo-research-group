Dr. Reihane Ziadlou obtained her PhD degree in the field of Biomedical Engineering in July 2020 from the medical faculty of Basel University and AO research Institute, Davos in Switzerland. Since then, she has started her post-doctoral fellowship at University of Zürich and medicine campus Davos. The main focus of her research is to investigate the immunological function of subcutaneous adipose tissue in cutaneous or systemic inflammation by using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and other multiplexed transcriptomics and proteomics technologies.

Concurrently she developed translational projects targeting epigenetics: In 2022, she was awarded a prestigious grant by the Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) and ETH Zürich for a 3-month postdoctoral fellowship at Kyoto university. She learned a breakthrough technology for targeted therapies using DNA-based small molecules (PIPs).  Using PIPs, she could target and epigenetically regulate inflammation in an in vitro inflammatory model of human tissue.
