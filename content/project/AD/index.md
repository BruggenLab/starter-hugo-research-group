Atopic Dermatitis: Sub-Saharan Africa vs. Central Europe It is already known that the ethnicity plays an important role in the presentation of AD. However, there is a lack of knowledge about possible variations in pathogenesis. In this prospective observational study, we are comparing AD patients and healthy control participants from Zurich and from Moshi, a city in Tanzania. We compare clinical characteristics, immune signatures, barrier proteins, sensitization patterns as well as the nasal, gut and skin microbiome between AD patients and healthy controls in Tanzania and Switzerland. This project is a collaboration between the University Hospital Zurich and the Regional Dermatology Training Centre in Moshi.

Atopic Dermatitis and Cardiovascular Diseases In this multicenter project, we want to further investigate the association between AD and cardiovascular diseases, as the existing evidence is contradictory. Weâ€™d like to answer questions such as: Are AD patients at a higher risk for cardiovascular comorbidities? Does the AD severity play a role? How does a possible connection relate to the presence of atopic comorbidities? We therefore analyze data from the ProRaD study (Prospective Longitudinal Observational Research in Atopic Dermatitis), which includes more than 705 AD patients and 80 healthy control participants and perform targeted high-throughput proteomics analyses.

Atopic Dermatitis and Food Allergies / Intolerances Many AD patients suffer from concurrent food allergies and even a higher percentage reports food-related exacerbations of their disease. In this project, we want to further explore the potential connection between food sensitization/allergies, food intolerances, nutritional habits and atopic comorbidities in AD patients.

Prospective Longitudinal Observational Research in Atopic Dermatitis (ProRaD) In ProRAD, a study of CK Care (LINK CK CARE WEBSITE/PRORAD), we investigate the mechanisms underlying the natural course, different disease phenotypes and therapy responsiveness in AD and look for new clinically relevant biomarkers as well as new potential therapeutic targets.
