We are thrilled to announce that our lab actively participated in the prestigious International Societies for Investigative Dermatology (ISID) conference held in Japan in May 2023. Our team of dedicated researchers and scientists showcased their groundbreaking projects, shedding light on various aspects of dermatology. Dr. Reihane Ziadlou captivated the audience with her presentation titled "Multiplexed spatial mapping of panniculitis: Deciphering the signatures of subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation," offering valuable insights into the complex nature of inflammation in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Dr. Nicola Herman presented her study entitled "Vitiligo-like-depigmentation in patients with melanoma under immunotherapy: Clinical presentation and prognostic features - A monocentric prospective observational study," revealing the clinical manifestations and prognostic markers of vitiligo-like depigmentation in melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy. Milad Ameri shared his research on "Novel insights into vitiligo-like depigmentation under immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma compared to classical vitiligo and healthy skin biopsies," providing fresh perspectives on the unique characteristics and underlying mechanisms of vitiligo-like depigmentation induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma, while comparing it to classical vitiligo and healthy skin biopsies. Additionally, Dr. Yongxing Fang presented his study entitled "Deciphering Sensitization Patterns in Atopic Dermatitis Patients with Atopic Comorbidities." His research delved into understanding the complex sensitization patterns observed in patients with atopic dermatitis who also have atopic comorbidities. These projects underscore our commitment to advancing dermatological knowledge and improving patient care.
